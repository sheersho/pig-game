GAME RULES:

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
In each turn, a player rolls the die as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score.
If both the Die give 6, then the GLOBAL score is set back to zero
After that, it's back to the original player's turn
The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

BONUS : You can set the winning score according to your choice in the 'Set Score' box
